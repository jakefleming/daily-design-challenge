      "text": "Just wanted to send a quick thank you for giving me confidence in trying to learn to code. I’m 28 now and didn’t think it was something I could do – (it still might not be) – but thanks to your book it’s given me an opportunity I don’t want to miss out on. Love your passion and it’s very inspiring."
    }, {
      "author": "Marshal",
      "text": "I started doing your Python course when I was unemployed...and it made a huge difference in my life. Because I had some programming knowledge, I was able to get a job for a financial company that needed someone who could do a bit of coding in addition to their regular duties. ... Now, I've gone from being one of the long-term unemployed to looking at buying my first home."

As one who has done lots of teaching allow me to compliment the course and your style. Just finished Exercise 12 and wanted to say thanks for putting this course together!"

      "text": "I've just bought Learn C the Hard Way while on a business trip, since the beta edition website has been incredibly useful. Thanks for that, by the way! Writing the simple database with dynamically allocated fields was more empowering than almost anything I've done as a programmer so far."

      "author": "Michael",

      "author": "Michael",
      "text": "I would like to say that I find your material absolutely terrific. Very pedagogical and methodical, taking it nice and slow. Perfect for a beginner and someone who thinks that technology can be a little intimidating like me. I've been running my own businesses for some years and have come to the realization how important it is to know at least some coding. Most importantly in order to be able to talk to and understand programmers (and balance up the information asymmetry), as well as making your own prototypes without the need to resort to external expertise."
    }, {
      "author": "Michael",
      "text": "To be completely honest, programming is one of the best things I have experienced. Truly. The combination of getting a chance to train your logic and making use of your own creativity is so very rewarding. And the almost endless number of applications you can put that knowledge into use is inspiring. I try to do at least 2 hours of programming every day, and it's something I look forward to each time I get out of bed. Thanks for that Zed! Without your online course I wouldn't have dared to take the leap."

      "author": "Kevin",
      "text": "I just completed the command line crash course and want to express my feeling towards your lessons and teaching methods. I have been learning all over the web about coding and very few places make me feel like I’m grasping the methods. I like how you “made” me make flash cards and things felt like a true bootcamp. I have learned a lot more about the command line and am not so afraid of it anymore. I wanted to ask if you have any JavaScript writings as I did not see any on your webpage, I will definitely be reading Ruby but JavaScript is really tripping me up in places and I could use better explanations for things than the ones I’ve seen."
    }, {
      "author": "Christopher",
      "text": "I'm reading your book, Learn Python the Hard Way, and really enjoying it. Your teaching approach is the best. I remember at the university, we would have to reach large and dense chapters on programming concepts before writing a line of code. It was insufferable. It should be the other way around, as you have recognized, writing code first and later reading as much about it as is necessary or desired. That deep understanding is important, but it's really impossible to achieve through reading alone and must instead spring forth from a foundation of hands on experience."

To give you some positive feedback, I recently used your site to refresh my C skills from Uni, having not used them in anger for a number of years. At the conclusion I applied for work as a C \\ Python developer. I feel as though I put my best foot forward, and my inner software engineer has gotten back its spark."

I had never done any programming before but I have a few friends and relatives who do it for a living and thought I would give it a try. I came across your books and got to work. The way your books are organized and how each chapter progressed in simple steps helped me a lot. I also appreciated your straight forward attitude and tone throughout. I just released my first iOS app for sale."},

Python’s readability and your teaching approach really helped me to finally overcome some mental obstacles to developing programming abilities that have frustrated me for a long time. I appreciate you making your knowledge available to the world for free. I found your 'what to tell know-it-all programmers' and general life observations just as interesting as the code."},
